        <h1 style="font:sans-serif;">Tangent circles, Machining and Parallel paths</h1>
        <p>This project assumes some knowledge of calculus but hopefully will still be understandable without it.</p>
        <p>If you've ever looked at a road youve probably alraeady seen a parallel curve and, if you look at it that </p>

        <p>The first question to ask is, what does this even mean. If you were to take a point on the curve and draw a circle, all points on the circle would have the same distance to the curve at that point</p>

        <p>the problem though is that the particular point on the circle that you choose is extremely important. (sidenote, if you just pick in a psuedorandom method for each point on the curve similar to conways base 13 function you actually end up filling up the space almost like a high stroke width).</p>
        <p>Picking just any point on that circle wont work though, theres a few obvious properties we want this curve to have.</p> 
        <li>It should be an actual connected curve. </li> 
        <li>tangent lines to one curve should be parallel to tangent lines of the other.</li>
        <li> The distance between corresponding points should be constant </li>
        <p>If you imagine taking a small step \({\Delta} t\) along the curve, most of the points which are in the direction of that step become closer to the curve and thus those points dont really fit the idea behind the curve. . There's actually a nice geometric way to interpret this. what we want is to find all the points where the distance to \(f(t+\Deltat)\leq\)the distance to \(f(t)\). to do that you can draw an ellipse which corresponds to points that have a total distance of \(2r\) from \(f(t) and f(t+{\Delta}t)\). Then the points with a distance lower than \(r\) from \(f(t+{\Delta}t)\) are the ppoints inside the ellipse and on the circle. Then, since the intersection of the ellipse and the circle happens at the midpoint of the two foci, and the foci approach each other as \(\Delta t\) approaches 0, the points outside the ellipse are on the other side of the circle.  </p>

        <p>Thus, there are only two points where no matter which direction you go the distance stays the same. those points are the points on the circle that are directly perpindicular to the curve. that means the line connecting them to the curve intersects the curve at a right angle.</p>
