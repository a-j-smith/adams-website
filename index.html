        This project assumes some knowledge of calculus but hopefully will still be understandable without it.

        <p>The first question to ask is, what does this even mean. If you were to take a point on the curve and draw a circle, all points on the circle would have the same distance to the curve at that point</p>

        <p>If you imagine taking a small step along the curve, the half of the points which are in the direction of that step become closer to the curve

Thus, there are only two points where no matter which direction you go the distance stays the same. those points are the points on the circle that are directly perpindicular to the curve. that means the line connecting them to the curve intersects the curve at a right angle.</p>
