        <h1 style="font:sans-serif;">Tangent circles, Curvature and Parallel paths</h1>
        <p>This project assumes some knowledge of calculus but hopefully will still be understandable without it.</p>
        <p>Have you seen some railroad tracks, maybe thought about function values that are close to but not quite on a curve, possibly wondered which side of a road is longer. All of these scenarios involve something called a parallel curve </p>
        <h2>Defining a parallel curve</h2> 
        <iframe src="https://www.desmos.com/calculator/v6r9oy54ql?embed" width="500" height="500" style="border: 1px solid #ccc" frameborder=0></iframe>
        <p>The first question to ask is, what does this even mean. Theres a good chance that until now you've always just thought about parallel as only applying to lines which strictly speaking is true but by changing the definitiona little bit we can apply it to curves as well. If you were to take a point on the curve and draw a circle, all points on the circle would have the same distance to the curve at that point</p>

        <p>the problem though is that the particular point on the circle that you choose is extremely important. for example if you always pick the highest point on the circle you just shift it up by one unit.</p> 
        <p>sidenote, if you just pick a (pseudo random) point on the circle for each point on the curve function you actually end up filling up the space like a high stroke width.</p>

        <p>That very naturally leads to a definition of a parallel curve as the envelope of a circle on every point of the curve. unfortunately that definition is very difficult to work with because given some point on the original curve you can't  get the corresponding point.</p>
        <iframe src="https://www.desmos.com/calculator/lv7m2tttdd?embed" width="500" height="500" style="border: 1px solid #ccc" frameborder=0></iframe>
        <p>Picking just any point on that circle wont work though, theres a few obvious properties we want this curve to have.</p> 
        <li>It should be an actual connected curve. </li> 
        <li>tangent lines to one curve should be parallel to tangent lines of the other.</li>
        <li> The distance between corresponding points should be constant </li>
        <p>If you imagine taking a small step \({\Delta} t\) along the curve, most of the points which are in the direction of that step become closer to the curve and thus those points dont really fit the idea behind the curve. . There's actually a nice geometric way to interpret this. what we want is to find all the points where the distance to \(f(t+\Delta t)\leq\)the distance to \(f(t)\). to do that you can draw an ellipse which corresponds to points that have a total distance of \(2r\) from \(f(t) and f(t+{\Delta}t)\). Then the points with a distance lower than \(r\) from \(f(t+{\Delta}t)\) are the ppoints inside the ellipse and on the circle. Then, since the intersection of the ellipse and the circle happens at the midpoint of the two foci, and the foci approach each other as \(\Delta t\) approaches 0, the points outside the ellipse are on the other side of the circle.  </p>

        <p>Thus, there are only two points where no matter which direction you go the distance stays the same. those points are the points on the circle that are directly perpindicular to the curve. that means the line connecting them to the curve intersects the curve at a right angle.</p>

        <p>That means that another way to construct a parallel curve to some curve \(\gamma\) is taking that curve and adding a unit normal vector</p>
        $$\gamma_d = \gamma + d*\hat{n}$$
        <p>and, because the normal vector to one curve is normal to the other</p>
        $$\gamma = \gamma_d - d*\hat{n}$$
        $$\text{where }d \in \mathbb{R}, \hat{n}\text{ is perpendicular to }\gamma\text{ and }||\hat{n}||=1$$
        <p>This definition is significantly eeasier to work because given that you can construct a normal (which is fairly simple) you can actually get a formula for a parallel curve. That makes it significantly easier to for example find the arclength which is a simple yet tedious calc problem.</p>
        <h2>Arc Length and Area</h2>
        <p>To find arc length, first we need to step back and think about speed. Thats because speed is (arc) length over time so given the speed (as a function of time) we can get the length. So, what's the speed of a particle on the other curve.</p>
        $$\text{by definition speed} = \sqrt{{v_x}^2+{v_y}^2} \text{and, because velocity is linear,} v_x(\gamma_d(t))=v_x(\gamma(t))+v_x(d*\hat{n(t)}) \text{and same for }v_y$$
        <p>The only way that \(d\hat{n}(t)\) can move is along a circle of radius d (keep in mind that this is true of any vector with length d it's not especially true here). Any line tangent to a circle is perpendicular to a radial line to the point of tangency.  \(d \hat{n}\) is a radial line  and since velocity is always tangent to a path, \(v(d \hat{n}\) is perpendicular to \(d \hat{n}\). Since it is perpendicular to a normal, it is parallel to \(v(\gamma(t)\) so \(v(d \hat{n}=d \kappa v(\gamma)\) (where \(\kappa\) is some scalar) \(v_x(d*\hat{n})=d*\kappa v_x(\gamma(t))\) and \(v_y(\hat{d*n(t)})=d*\kappa v_y(\gamma(t))\) so the speed is \(\sqrt{v_x^2+v_y^2}=\sqrt{(v_x(\gamma(t))+v_x(d*\hat{n}(t)))^2+(v_y(\gamma(t))+v_y(d*\hat{n}(t))))^2}=\sqrt{((1+d\kappa)v_x(\gamma(t)))^2+((1+d\kappa)v_Y(\gamma(t)))^2}=(1+d\kappa)\sqrt{v_x(\gamma)^2+v_y(\gamma)^2}=v(\gamma)(1+d\kappa)\)</p>
        <p>so now the question is, what is \(\kappa\). well, by our definition it's the number to convert between speed on the curve and the speed of the normal vector. Since \(\hat{n}\) is constrained to lie on a circle its pretty natural to parameterize its velocity with its angular velocity.</p>
        $$\frac{||v(d\hat{n})||}{v(\gamma)}=\frac{d\omega}{r\omega} = \frac{d}{r}=d\kappa, \kappa = \frac{1}{r}$$
        <p>so what is r. If you imagine extending the normal line until you reach a point that is stationary that length gives you r and, you might notice, if you actually trace a circle there it has the same position as the curve, it has the same velocity at that point and it has the same acceleration as the curve at that point. Since those 3 parameters uniquely define a circle this circle is the only circle that fits the curve to third order. This circle that fits the curve best has a special name, its called the osculating circle (from the latin for kissing circle) and the \(\frac{1}{r}\) isnt actually just \(\frac{1}{r}\) but \(\frac{1 rad}{r}\) in other words its bassically how much you rotate along the circle per unit distance travelled. Since a tighter circle corresponds to a higher \(\kappa\) and in a sense it measures how much something bends per unit length calling it curvature is also a pretty natural decision. </p>
        <iframe src="https://www.desmos.com/calculator/1leyrffsok?embed" width="500" height="500" style="border: 1px solid #ccc" frameborder=0></iframe>
        Notice how on one side of the circle it goes down and on the other it goes up.
        <p>Back to the original question we know the speed of a particle on the curve is \(v(\gamma)+d*v\kappa\) and obviously the v term just gives us the arc length of the original curve so all that is left is to figure out what the \(d*v\kappa\) part means. since \(\kappa\) gives the angle traveled per unit of arc length and speed is arclength per unit of time it should make sense that \(v(\gamma)\kappa\) gives the angle per unit time. in the same way that speed gave distance this angular speed gives an angle as an output (displacement beause its signed). Specifically it gives whats called the total curvature which can be interpreted as the difference in angle between the start and end points. (for calc people this is just the chain rule \(\frac{d\theta}{ds}\frac{ds}{dt}=\frac{d\theta}{dt} and so \int \kappa ds = \int v\kappa dt\)) This all means that the total length of some parallel curve is linearly dependant on d and is \(s_\gamma + d\Delta \theta\).</p>
        <p>There is one problem however and it happens whenever \(d\kappa \gt 1\). In that case the curvature is negative but the speed can't be as low as it needs to be for the equality to hold. If it were to, it would be negative.</p>
        <p>Now, moving on to area which surprisingly is considerably simpler. We already know that area is just arc length * width but since length varies we unfortunately can't just multiply them. We know that length is proportional to distance from the curve plus initial length so that means we can imgaine stretching out the curves to be straight lines. Then, because the length is just linearly dependant on distance the shape formed is a trapezoid so the area formula is simply \(d\frac{s_\gamma+(s_\gamma+d\Delta \theta)}{2}\)</p>

        <p>trying it with a line is boring because it just gives l*d but a circle is actually interesting. On the one hand it should be \(\pi(r+d)^2-\ pi r^2 = 2\pi rd+\pi d^2\) but plugging in to the formula \(d\frac{s_\gamma+(s_\gamma+d\Delta \theta)}{2}=d\frac{2\pi r+(2\pi r+d2\pi)}{2} = 2\pi r d +\pi d^2 \)</p>
        <h2>Generalization</h2>
        <p>Parallel curves are very simple to generalize to higher dimensions. we've actually already done it. Nothing in our definition explicitly depends on dimension and its not difficult to construct a multidimensional normal to a surface. As for generalizing the length, in that direction lies only pain. You may think, "why can't we just use the same trick we used in the 2d case for this." The answer is that it doesn't work, the same line of reasoning says the change in the normal vector has to be in the plane tangent to the surface but the change in the normal vector for some step is not in general parallel to that step. To verify this you could think of a surface that slopes upwards in the direction perpendicular to your step.</p>
        <p>If you think of a small step on the tangent plane, the change in the normal vector almost lies on that plane and the smaller the step is the closer it is. That means we can define an operator S that maps from the plane tangent to the curve to itself and locally looks like the change in the normal vector. What we want is some vector such that the change in the normal vector looks like the original vector scaled up or down a little bit . in other words \(S\vec{v}=\lambda \vec{v}\). If we can do that, we can apply a similar arguement as the 2d case. Since the tranformation is linear, we can use the eigenvectors of S, if they exist, and rewrite our vectors as a combination of eigenvectors. The operator S is called the shape operator and is self adjoint. This isnt entirely clear but because \(N \cdot F_u = 0,  N \cdot F_v = 0\) their derivatives must be 0 as well so \(N_v \cdot F_u + N \cdot F_{uv} = 0 and N_u \cdot F_v + N \cdot F_{uv} = 0, N_u \cdot F_v = N_v \cdot F_u\) in other words, (where a and b are both in the tangent plane) \(S(a) \cdot b = S(b) \cdot a\). Using the fundamental theorem of algebra, there must exist at least one (possibly complex) eigenvalue \(\lambda\) but since \( \lambda v \cdot v ) = (S(v) \cdot v) = (v \cdot \bar{S(v)}) = (\bar{\lambda}(v \cdot v)))\) it must be equal to its own conjugate and thus must be real. Then considering a vector p perpendicular to v \(v \cdot p = S(v) \cdot p = 0 = v \cdot S(p))\) hence S(p) must be perpendicular to v as well so, since in 2d space theres only one vector perpendicular to v S(p) must be on the span of p and so p must be another eigenvector. Thinking about curvature in 2d, you might realize that theres a nice way to define curvature in 3d given a direction which is to take the plane in that direction and take a cross section of the curve. To find the curvature, you find the change in the normal vector as before, but then you have to project it into the 2d space. in other words \(\kappa(\hat{u}) = S(\hat{u})\cdot \hat{u}\). If u is an eigenvector, we know that \(S(u) \cdot u = \lambda (u \dot u) = \lambda\). given that an arbitrary unit vector can be decomposed as a sum of the two eigenvectors v1 and v2 \(u = v_1 \sin(\theta) + v_2\cos(\theta), S(u) \cdot u = S(v_1 \sin(\theta) + v_2\cos(\theta)) \cdot (v_1 \sin(\theta) + v_2\cos(\theta)) = \lambda_1 sin^2(\theta) + \lambda_2 cos^2(\theta)\) (This is known as Eulers theorem because Euler really had to do everything) Its clear that the eigenvalues of the operator M are the maximum and minimum curvatures then. </p>
        \(\iint||r_u \times r_v|| du dv = \iint||(a_u+d n_u)\times(a_v+d n_v)|| du dv = \iint ||a_u\times a_v + a_u \times d n_v + d n_u \times a_v + d n_u \times d n_v|| du dv\) fortunately since all of them lie in the same plane, the cross products are all in the same direction and the magnitude part can simply be ignored (for now). Now rewriting the derivatives of the normal vector as the shape operator applied to derivatives of the function, \(\iint ||a_u\times a_v + a_u \times d n_v + d n_u \times a_v + d n_u \times d n_v|| du dv = \iint ||a_u\times a_v + da_u \times S(a_v) + d S(a_u) \times a_v + d^2 S(a_u) \times  S(a_v)|| du dv\) </p>
        $$=\iint ||a_u\times a_v + da_u \times S(||a_v||(v_1 sin(\theta_2) + v_2 cos(\theta_2) + d S(||a_u||(v_1 sin(\theta_1) + v_2 cos(\theta_1)) \times a_v + d^2 S(||a_u||(v_1 sin(\theta_1) + v_2 cos(\theta_1)) \times  S(||a_v||(v_1 sin(\theta_2) + v_2 cos(\theta_2)|| du dv$$
        $$=\iint ||a_u\times a_v + d(||a_u||(v_1 sin(\theta_1) + v_2 cos(\theta_1) \times ||a_v||(\kappa_1 v_1 sin(\theta_2) + \kappa_2 v_2 cos(\theta_2) + d ||a_u||(\kappa_1 v_1 sin(\theta_1) + \kappa_2 v_2 cos(\theta_1)) \times ||a_v||(v_1sin(\theta_2) + v_2 cos(\theta_2)) + d^2 (||a_u||(\kappa_1 v_1 sin(\theta_1) + \kappa_2 v_2 cos(\theta_1)) \times  ||a_v||(\kappa_1 v_1 sin(\theta_2) + \kappa_2 v_2 cos(\theta_2)|| du dv$$

        $$=\iint ||a_u\times a_v + ||a_u||||a_v||(d(\kappa_2 cos(\theta_1)sin(\theta_2) - d\kappa_1 sin(\theta_1)cos(\theta_2)(v_1 \times v_2)  + d\kappa_1 sin(\theta_1)cos(\theta 2) - d\kappa_2 sin(\theta 2)cos(\theta 1) (v_1 \times v_2)) + d^2 (( \kappa_1 \kappa_2 (sin(\theta_1) cos(\theta_2) - cos(\theta_1) sin(\theta_2) (v_1  \times v_2)|| du dv$$
        $$=\iint ||(1 + d\kappa_1 +d\kappa_2 +d^2 \kappa_1 \kappa_2)||a_u||||a_v||sin(\theta)(v_1 \times v_2)||du dv$$
        $$=\iint(1+d\kappa_1+d\kappa_2+d^2\kappa_1 \kappa_2)dA$$
        <p>Using the Gauss Bonnet theorem,</p>
        $$\iint \kappa_1 \kappa_2 ||a_u \times a_v||du dv = \iint_M d^2 K dA = d^2 (2\pi \chi - \int_{\partial M} \kappa_g ds)$$
        
        <p>From here I would guess that in general the n dimension area of an n dimensional surface is \(\int \prod_1^{n} (1+\kappa_n dx_n)\)\)but this is just pure extrapolation.</p>
        <h2>Application</h2>
            <p>Surprisingly, these curves actually pop up very regularly in things like machining and path design. In machining, because the thing you cut with has thickness its important that you never get too close to the surface. Many paths are intentionally designed to be roughly constant width. That means that the outside of some path will be longer than the inside. That means that in the context I originally learned about this problem, path efficiency, the answer is that the most efficient path is whichever one ends up being on the inside and its independent of the precise path.</p>
            <h2>Conclusions</h2>
            <p>Often when it comes to solving some problem, defining the thing to work with in a useful manner is half the battle. Once you get a useful definition, the actual math is often not too bad. While the 2d case was fairly simple, trying to generalize lead to a lot of difficulty because of some implicit assumptions. Simple problems can often lead to deep rabbitholes with no visible end.</p>
